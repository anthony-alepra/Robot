# Robot
Robotic Arm (Armio) that uses machine vision (OpenMV) to find AprilTags

This is intended to work with the robotic arm from microrobotlabs "Armio" https://microbotlabs.com/index.html
and the OpenMV camera https://openmv.io/

This program will have the robot arm scan a room for an AprilTag (can be printed from the OpenMV IDE), and will
center on and track the tag when moved.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Upload main.py to the OpenMV camera using the IDE
2. Upload the ino file to the Arduino microcontroller using the Arduino IDE
